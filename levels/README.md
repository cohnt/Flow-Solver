Sample level file:

.RBO.

On the first line, the first number is the number of rows, and the second number is the number of columns (the board need not be square).

To represent a flow source of a given color, use the appropriate character below.

To represent a blank space, use any non-newline character (I would recommend something like `.` or `+`).
